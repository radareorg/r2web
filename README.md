## r2web: __Access radare2 from anywhere, anytime.__



https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d60bc1a-2e91-4868-ac5f-3a861d0af537



## Overview

r2web lets you run radare2 without local installs or platform hassles. Analyze files directly in your browser. It runs entirely client-side using radare2 WASI and Wasmer, with an [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) frontend for interactive command execution.

👉 [Try it live](https://r2.revengi.in)

## Features

- **Browser-based**: No local installation required
- **Cross-platform**: Works on any device with a modern browser (since older browsers don't support WASI/WASM)
- **Terminal Interface:** Interact with r2 via a familiar terminal.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Navigate quickly using some known GUI shortcuts (like `Ctrl+G` for seek).
- **Search:** Ability to search in large outputs of commands.
- **Custom r2 versions:** Use any version of r2 you want.
- **Quick Buttons:** Buttons for common commands like `pd`, `px`, `iz`.

## Under the Hood

r2web uses:

*   React+TypeScript+Vite
*   [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) for the terminal interface
*   Wasmer for running WASM
*   r2wasm for the WASM build of radare2

## Development

To run locally:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/radareorg/r2web.git
cd r2web
bun install
bun dev
```

you'll need to run a very small proxy api server to workaround with browser's CORS policy, to do that run:
```shell
bun run api/wasm.cjs # or node api/wasm.cjs if you don't have bun installed
```
which will run a local proxy server at `http://localhost:3000/wasm`, that will be used to fetch the wasm file from the github releases.

Or you can run both dev & proxy server at the same time using:
```shell
bun cc
```

Or skip the setup and [try it live](https://r2.revengi.in).

> [!TIP]
> If you don't have bun installed, you can use npm or yarn or any other package manager which you have installed. Just replace `bun` with `npm` or `yarn` (or any other package manager) in the above commands.

## Notes

- This is a work in progress. Expect bugs and missing features.
- The radare2 binary is downloaded on first load and cached for future use (an option to disable caching is also given).
- ~~Currently there's no way to save modified files, (seems like an issue on r2wasm side), figuring out a way to fix it.~~ (Fixed on r2 versions 6.0.3 onwards...)
